# Aptos Smart Contracts Collection

Hello, everyone! I hope you're doing well at work and in your learning journey.

As I explored writing smart contracts for the Aptos blockchain using the Move language, I noticed that resources are limited and often difficult to find. To save you time and effort, I’ve gathered some essential examples from the official documentation.

These contracts are designed to give you a broader understanding of how things work on the Aptos blockchain. While I didn’t write all of them from scratch, they’ve been organized here for easy reference.

Here’s what you’ll find in this collection:

1. **Aptos Object**:  
   A simple smart contract demonstrating how objects and storage mechanisms work in Aptos.

2. **Multisig and Signature Verification Module**:  
   This module combines multisignature functionality with signature verification, helping you understand these key concepts on Aptos.

3. **Aptos Fungible Asset**:  
   Learn how to implement a fungible token with functionalities like transferability and burnability.

4. **Aptos Soulbound NFT**:  
   This contract shows how to mint lifetime-bound NFTs directly into any wallet.

Each module includes a dedicated `README` file to guide you through its functionality and use.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.

Happy coding!
